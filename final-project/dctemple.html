                <p><b>Site Dedication:</b>  14 February 1853 by Heber C. Kimball</p>

            <h3>Temple Facts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Salt Lake Temple was the fourth temple built in Utah (though its construction was started first) and the first built in the Salt Lake Valley.</li>
                    <li>The Salt Lake Temple was the only temple dedicated by President Wilford Woodruff.</li>
                    <li>With its distinctive spires and statue of the angel Moroni, the Salt Lake Temple is an international symbol of the Church.</li>
                    <li>The Salt Lake Temple is the largest temple (most square footage) of the Church.</li>
                    <li>Original plans for the Salt Lake Temple called for two angel Moroni statues—one on the east central spire and one on the west.</li>
                    <li>The Salt Lake Temple took 40 years to build with its highly ornate interior being completed in just a year. (View the story of the building of the Salt Lake Temple.)</li>
                    <li>During the construction of the Salt Lake Temple, the St. George Utah Temple, Logan Utah Temple, and Manti Utah Temple were all started and completed.</li>
                    <li>The walls of the Salt Lake Temple are nine feet thick at the base and six feet thick at the top.</li> 
                    <li>The Salt Lake Temple is the first temple to feature a standing angel Moroni statue, which is 14-feet tall and attached to a rod that extends 27 feet into the tower, 
                        terminating with a 4,000-pound counterbalance to keep the statue immovable. The angel was created by Paris-trained sculptor Cyrus E. Dallin and built in Salem, Ohio.</li>
                    <li>The Salt Lake Temple features beautiful hand-painted murals on the walls of its progressive-style ordinance rooms: Creation Room, Garden Room, World Room, 
                        Terrestrial Room (no murals), and Celestial Room (no murals).</li>
                    <li>The Salt Lake Temple is one of only seven temples where patrons progress through four ordinance rooms before passing into the Celestial Room. (The other six temples 
                        are the Manti Utah Temple, the Laie Hawaii Temple, the Cardston Alberta Temple, the Idaho Falls Idaho Temple, the Los Angeles California Temple, and the Nauvoo Illinois Temple.)</li>
                    <li>The Salt Lake Temple is one of two temples that still employ live acting for presentation of the endowment. (The other is the Manti Utah Temple.)</li>
                    <li>The Salt Lake Temple was completed the afternoon before the dedication. That evening, invited non-Mormon government officials, businessmen and their wives were 
                        given a complete tour of the temple. It was the first time that a temple had been opened to the public prior to its dedication.</li>
                    <li>The Salt Lake Temple was dedicated on April 6, 1893—three years before Utah became a state in 1896.</li>
